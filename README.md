Advent of Code 2023
===================
These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles.

__BE WARNED__: Spoilers ahead!

## Layout
The solutions are organized in crates, one for each day. Each crate contains a `lib.rs` file with the solution.
The inputs are stored in the `inputs` directory under the root of the repository, named by day.

## Running
To run the solutions, you need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed.
Then, you can run the solutions with `cargo run --bin advent_of_code XX`, where `XX` is the day number. 
For example, to run the solution for day 1, you would run `cargo run --bin advent_of_code 1`.

## Rules
In addition to the rules of the puzzles, I have set myself some additional rules:
- The solutions must be written in Rust, which I have never used before.
- My only reference material for learning Rust is GitHub Copilot. I have never read any Rust documentation.
- I can use Copilot Chat to ask for help, but I cannot ask for help from any other source.
